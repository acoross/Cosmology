## üîç Opening

This document proposes a speculative but physically motivated interpretation of cosmological time and causality based on general relativity (GR), thermodynamics, and the internal structure of black holes. It is **not a formal theory**, nor backed by full mathematical derivation, but rather an attempt to reassemble existing well-known pieces of physics into a coherent and intuitive explanatory model.

The goal is simple:  
If a single framework can explain more existing ‚Äúwhy‚Äùs ‚Äî including the arrow of time, entropy increase, cosmological expansion, and causality ‚Äî using fewer assumptions than current models (e.g., ŒõCDM + inflation), then it deserves to be considered, tested, or even just debated.

## 1. Spacetime Inside a Black Hole

- Inside a black hole, the spacetime structure can be analyzed via ADM decomposition. Along the infall time \( t \), causality becomes disconnected, and 2D spherical slices are sequentially stacked toward the center. Each slice becomes a dimensionally-reduced 2+1D spacetime, with the **radial direction becoming the time axis**.
- Within each individual slice, causality and physical laws operate normally.
- In a higher-dimensional universe (e.g., 4+1D), the slices on the inner shell of a black hole become 3+1D spacetimes.  
  ‚Üí These conditions are identical to our observable universe.
- Each individual slice may be flat depending on internal conditions.

## 2. Thermodynamic Time

- Thermodynamic time flows in the direction of increasing entropy (by our cognitive structure).  
- Entropy increases along the direction in which a force acts.  
- Gravity is the most dominant and large-scale force, always attractive and never shielded or canceled. Therefore, **gravity is the most fundamental source of entropy increase**.
- A massive black hole inside which all local time axes (spacetime-derived) are fixed toward a common center creates a **global thermodynamic arrow of time**.  
  ‚Üí Gravity, especially within such a system, is the **source of a universal time direction**.
- Therefore, if one assumes a **globally uniform entropy increase across the universe**, it implies that this universe must be **inside a black hole-like environment**, with gravity fixing causal direction at all slices.

## 3. Spacetime and the Time Axis

- Within a black hole, the direction toward the center becomes **timelike**.  
  ‚Üí This is not a coordinate choice, but a geometric result of the curvature.
- The curvature of a black hole transforms what would be a spatial direction into a **global time axis**.
- Outside such an environment, the time axis cannot be globally fixed.

## 4. The Merger of Two Concepts of Time

- Both **thermodynamic time** and **spacetime time** emerge from gravity.  
  ‚Üí That‚Äôs why their directions coincide.
- A **globally directed time axis**, as observed in our universe, can only emerge from an environment where gravity fixes all causality in a single direction ‚Äî e.g., the inside of a black hole.

## 5. Time in the Quantum Regime

- Thermodynamic time is driven by gravity.  
- Every quantum particle carries energy ‚Üí mass ‚Üí gravity.  
- Thus, each quantum particle defines **a local time direction** in its own vicinity.
- Therefore, quantum behavior may appear to **violate global causality**, since it reflects local time axes rather than a shared universal one.

## 6. ADM Slice Spacing and Quantum Superposition

- The spacing between ADM slices can be assumed to be Planck-scale.  
- A quantum particle in superposition is "spread across multiple slices."
- Observing such a particle from within a single slice results in **nonlocal, hidden-variable-like behavior**,  
  ‚Üí but this **does not violate Bell's inequality**, since the hidden variable is distributed across spacetime slices and is not strictly local.

## 7. Inflation and Spacetime Structure

- The "expansion" of space under extreme black hole curvature is not literal, but a **relative stretching of spatial coordinates** due to extreme tilting of light cones inward.
- Light speed remains invariant; if the light cone tilts sharply in the time direction, the spatial frame **appears to expand**.
  ‚Üí This can create an apparent inflation effect without requiring exotic scalar fields.

## 8. Black Hole Cosmology

- Big Bang cosmology assumes a singularity at the origin.
- However, it gives no account of **how the universe could "exit" the black hole condition**.
- This model argues instead that the universe has never exited, and is still **inside a black hole**.
- The flatness and normal causality of the current universe are natural consequences of the **internal conditions of black hole slices**.
- A globally unidirectional time flow implies a **global gravitational anchor**,  
  ‚Üí which is only naturally explained if the **entire observable universe lies on the internal shell of a black hole**.
